# JANUS Portfolio
(C) 1999-2017 Hernan Monserrat

In this spot you will find all the information related to some projects developed at Janus between 1999-2009.
The aim of this "Museum" is to let you find User Manuals, technical descriptions, pictures and so on.
On the other hand, it is a place where I can show off with the work I've done ;)
Drop me a line if you want to know more about any of these projects.
